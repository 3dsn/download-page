exercise/lab CSV2JSON

Initially I could log json Object but can't save to a file.

So I saw edwincapel's code and everything become clear. 

Ok, I forgot JSON.stringify, but now its working ok. See csv2stringify2json.js

It get csv from the web by parameter or default url and convert it in memory to json after that write to file inside a uuid folder. 

Tks to 'edwincapel'
